# Personal Website

![license: mit][license_shield] [![code style: prettier][prettier_shield]][prettier]

My personal minimalist spot on the web, built with [Preact][preact],
[Typescript][typescript] and [Sass][sass], bundled with [Parcel][parcel] and
formatted with [Prettier][prettier].

## Fast

I wanted a simple website with fast load times without sacrificing
the component-based approach of React. The solution was to use Preact which has
a much smaller footprint: infact, this website is just shy of 11KB gzipped
~~excluding the font which, sadly, adds another 13KB. However, font loading is
deferred using [font-display][google-font-display] to reduce the time to FMP~~.
The font face is provided by the system to avoid loading another hefty remote
resource, just like [GitHub does][github_fonts].

The site also scores 100/100 in Google Chrome's
[Lighthouse audit tool][lighthouse] Performance test (Chrome build: 69,
Device: Mobile, Throttling: Applied Fast 3G, 4x CPU Slowdown, Clear Storage:
yes, Enabled Chrome extensions: none).
